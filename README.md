# 🌠 Asteroid Tracker

**Asteroid Tracker** is a high-performance web app that fetches real-time asteroid data from NASA 🌍🚀, analyzing **potentially hazardous objects, closest approaches, and fastest-moving asteroids** to provide a clear, data-driven overview of near-Earth objects.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Dynamic Data Fetching** – Retrieves asteroid details from a backend API with timeout handling.  
✅ **Interactive Table** – Displays asteroid **ID, name, close approach date, miss distances**, and **velocity**.  
✅ **Real-Time Filtering & Highlighting** – Emphasizes key asteroids based on approach distance and speed.  
✅ **Loading Animation** – Immersive **planet animation** 🪐 during data retrieval for a seamless experience.  
✅ **Optimized Performance** – Handles large datasets efficiently with structured data parsing.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

🔹 **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
🔹 **Backend API:** Spring Boot (serving asteroid data)  
🔹 **Gemini API:** To provide a summary about the Asteroid data  
🔹 **Data Handling:** Fetch API with AbortController & timeout logic  

## 🚀 How It Works

1️⃣ The app fetches asteroid data from a Spring Boot backend.  
2️⃣ Data is parsed and displayed in a user-friendly table.  
3️⃣ A space-themed **loading animation** 🪐 appears until the data is fully loaded.  
4️⃣ Filtering and highlighting mechanisms make it easy to spot critical asteroids.

## 🌍 Run the Project

1️⃣ Clone this repo:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/asteroid-tracker.git
cd asteroid-tracker
```
2️⃣ Start the backend (Spring Boot) server.  
3️⃣ Open `index.html` in a browser and watch the asteroids fly in! 🚀
